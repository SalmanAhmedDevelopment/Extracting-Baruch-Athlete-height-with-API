# Extracting-Baruch-Athlete-height-with-API
The project aims to find out if the average Baruch College swimmers is taller than the average Baruch College volleyball players.  I have extracted the data from Baruch different Athlete Web pages using BeautifulSoup and used Python to find the average. In conclusion, Volleyball players of both genders are taller than the average height of swimmers.
